Knapsack Problem:

- Maximum weight that knapsack can carry.

Example:
- Choosing food from a menu with maximum calories someone can have in one meal where the calories do not exceed defined threshold

Algorithms:
- Greedy:
-- While threshold not reached add avaliable food based on any given constrains.
- Brute force
-- enumerate all possible combinations of items
-- Remove all combinations that exceed the calories threshold
-- From the remaining combinations, choose the foods with the highest calories
